## libraries to run potential expansions 

This project provides a standalone interface to evaluate basis function expansion forces for a flexible number of components.

Each component is described by four objects:
1. Sturm-Louiville solution basis functions
2. The spherically-symmetric monopole model
3. The weights for the basis through time
4. (optional) The location of the basis centre through time

The libraries to realise the potentials are in include/. Some examples are located in the top folder.
